## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [background-position css property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me for understanding the positioning on images in a div without having to use an `<img>` element, I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
